## Purpose of This Site

The goal of this site is to have a place where you can look for examples of code. Think of this site as a log of all of the topics we cover in class and in lab sessions. I will make updates throughout the semester as we cover more advanced material.

Let me know if any of this code doesnâ€™t run correctly or if you have any questions or issues!

## Loading Data

The easiest way to load data into R and ensure you have the correct file path is to create a folder on your computer for each assignment and place the datasets directly into that folder.

1. Create a folder on your computer for each new analysis

2. Download your Data and move the file to your newly created folder

3. Then open RStudio

4. Click the project button in the top right corner

5. Click new project

6. Click existing directory

7. Click browse and find the folder that you created

8. Click create project

9. Once your new project opens, click the blank page with a green plus sign icon in the top left corner under the file option

10. Click R script to open a new script

11. You should also be able to see your data file in the bottom right window of RStudio, click the file and follow the options depending on the file type

12. Once your data is imported into R, the code that R automatically ran will be in the console window on the bottom left, copy and paste it to your fresh R script
  - For example, in Lab 1, my code looked like: `read_excel("Data/USstates.xlsx")`

13. Run this copy and pasted line of code whenever you open the R Project and you will never have to worry about complicated file pathing commands

14. I recommend using the assignment operator `<-` to give  your dataset a short and simple name like `df`, `dta`, or, if you are working with multiple datasets, name each something short and descriptive.

#### Saving data and loading data ####
 
# Create a data set (Table 1.2)
# tibble() is the equivalent of data.frame() tidyverse function from the tibble package
UNpop <- data.frame(world.pop = world.pop,
                    year = year)

# Get basic information about the data set

names(UNpop)

nrow(UNpop)

ncol(UNpop)

dim(UNpop)

summary(UNpop)

UNpop$world.pop

UNpop[, "world.pop"] # extract the column called "world.pop"
UNpop[c(1, 2, 3, 5), ]   # extract the first three rows (and all columns)
UNpop[1:3, "year"]   # extract the first three rows of the "year" column

UNpop$world.pop[seq(from = 1, to = nrow(UNpop), by = 2)]

# File paths and working directory

getwd() # Confirm the change

#### Getting Help: mean() example ####

world.pop <- c(UNpop$world.pop, NA)
world.pop

mean(world.pop)

## Use Question Marks to see help documentation

## Intro to `library(tidyverse)`

```{r}

# Packages

## install.packages("devtools") # install the package
library(devtools) # load the package

## install a package from github
## devtools::install_github("kosukeimai/qss-package", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(qss) ## loading in qss
## You may need to allow R to update/install additional packages

## Loading in tidyverse
## install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

## Loading in a Dataset
data(UNpop, package = "qss")

## Number of Rows and Columns - Base R
dim(UNpop)

## Number of observation, number of variables, and initial observations - tidyverse
glimpse(UNpop)

## First 6 rows
head(UNpop)

## Last 6 Rows
tail(UNpop)

## Selecting A Variable - Base R
UNpop$world.pop

## subset all rows for the column called "world.pop" from the UNpop data
UNpop[, "world.pop"]
## subset the first three rows (and all columns)
UNpop[c(1, 2, 3),]
## subset the first three rows of the "year" column
UNpop[1:3, "year"]

## Now with tidyverse

## Subset the first three rows of UNpop with tidyverse
slice(UNpop, n = 1:3)

## Extract/subset the world.pop variable (column)
select(UNpop, world.pop)

## Base R subset the first three rows of the year variable
UNpop[1:3, "year"]
## or in tidyverse, combining slice() and select()
select(slice(UNpop, 1:3), year)

## Basic Data Wrangling with the tidyverse using pipes (i.e., %>%)

UNpop %>% # take the UNpop data we have loaded, and then...
  slice(1:3) %>% # subset the first three rows, and then...
  select(year) # subset the year column

UNpop %>%
  slice(seq(1, n(), by = 2)) %>% # using a sequence from 1 to n()
  select(world.pop)

pop.1970 <- UNpop %>% # take the UNpop data and then....
  filter(year == 1970) %>% # subset rows where the year variable is equal to 1970
  select(world.pop) %>% # subset just the world.pop column
  pull() # return a vector, not a tibble

## Print the vector to the console to see it
print(pop.1970)

UNpop.mill <- UNpop %>% # create a new tibble from UNpop
  mutate(world.pop.mill = world.pop / 1000) %>% # create a new variable, world.pop.mill
  select(-world.pop) # drop the original world.pop column

## Adding a variable with if_else
UNpop.mill <- UNpop.mill %>%
  mutate(after.1980 = if_else(year >= 1980, 1, 0))

## Creating a vector of the years of interest
specific.years <- c(1950, 1980, 2000)

## Adding a variable with if_else and %in%
UNpop.mill <- UNpop.mill %>%
  mutate(year.of.interest = if_else(year %in% specific.years, 1, 0))

summary(UNpop.mill)
mean(UNpop.mill$world.pop.mill)

## Add a row where values for all columns is NA
UNpop.mill.wNAs <- UNpop.mill %>%
  add_row(year = NA, world.pop.mill = NA,
          after.1980 = NA,
          year.of.interest = NA)
## Take the mean of world.pop.mill (returns NA)
mean(UNpop.mill.wNAs$world.pop.mill)
## Take the mean of world.pop.mill (ignores the NA)
mean(UNpop.mill.wNAs$world.pop.mill, na.rm = TRUE)

## Other Summary Statistics with tidyverse
UNpop.mill %>%
  summarize(mean.pop = mean(world.pop.mill),
            median.pop = median(world.pop.mill))

UNpop.mill %>%
  group_by(after.1980) %>% # create subset group for each value of after.1980
  summarize(mean.pop = mean(world.pop.mill)) # calculate mean for each group

```
